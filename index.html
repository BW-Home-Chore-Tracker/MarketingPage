            <p>Every parent knows the struggle of getting their kids to consistently and meaningfully contribute to the household chores. If you are tired of the exorbitant allowance demands, half-done chores, and dubious claims that "I can't put that away because I don't know where it goes!" or "Johnny's parents are better than you because they don't make him do chores...", then ChoreChallenge is the tool you have been waiting for. </p>

            <p>With ChoreChallenge, it's easy to get your kids excited about chores with our "gamified" approach to household chore tracking and management. Easily create a list of chores (or use one of our templates) and then randomly assign them to your children.</p>

            <p>Foster healthy competition and habits with <span>ChoreScore</span> and <span>CleanStreaks</span>: our proprietary chore rating and tracking tools that have been (un)scientifically proven to be 100% more effective than side-eye and time-outs. </p>
